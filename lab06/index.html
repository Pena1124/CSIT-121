            <h3> Movie Review</h3>
            <p>Rocky Balboa is an absolute classic which was filmed in 1976. So many years have passed by and I absolutely love watching it over and over and I never get tired of it. Rocky Balboa was the 1st movie of the Rocky series. This unique series made Sylvester Stallone's name known all over the world. This movie gives the feeling of sadness and joy because it tells the story of Rocky as a poor up and coming boxer who was given 1 chance and took advantage of the opportunity and made his name known for being a tough fighter.
