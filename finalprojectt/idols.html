<h1>My idols</h1> 
<p>Welcome ! On this page, I will be talking about the 2 biggest athletes I look up to. I will give their names and why I look up to them. I will also provide a table with some of the best players in history and some of their best accomplishments.</p>
<h2>Lionel Messi</h2>
<p>My all time favorite soccer player as well as role model is Lionel Messi. He is an Argentinian soccer player who played for FC Barcelona from 2004 to 2021. Growing up, I watched how he played and acted on the field and he was such a great role model to me. He was always a calm and quiet player, but he was always the best on the field. He was never a cocky player and he still remains humble even though he is the best soccer player in the world.</p>
<h2>Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
<p>Cristiano Ronaldo was a Portoguese soccer player who played for Real Madrid from 2009-2018. In my opinion, he is the 2nd best soccer player in the world. He was Messi's rival for many years. Even though Ronaldo wasn't my favorite player, as I got older, I realized how much I have learned from watching him. He was a cocky player, but he had every right to be because of all the hate and criticism he recieved when he would have bad days. </p>
