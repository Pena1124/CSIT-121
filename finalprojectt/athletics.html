<h3> FC Barcelona</h3>
<p>I was and still am a huge fan of the club "FC Barcelona" and I would watch them every single time they would play growing up. It is a bit harder to watch them every game now due to school and work, but I still try my best to keep up with everything. Down below is an image of the soccer players who played for FC Barcelona in 2009-2010, which is when I became a fan of them.</p>
