 <h1>Reflection on Final Project</h1>   
 <p>On this page, I will provide my personal reflection on this Final Project ! I will also talk about the challenges I had as well as the accomplishments I had doing this project. I will also talk about what I have learned in this course this semester !</p>
 <h2>Final Project</h2>
 <p>The Final Project was very fun to me ! I enjoyed implementing information about myself and things not a lot of people know about me. The biggest challenge I had was creating a table, which had information about the best soccer players in the hisotry of the sport. The biggest accomplishment I had in this project was the linking all the pages to each other.</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned In This Course</h2>
<p>I learned many things in this course this semester. I also struggled with some topics, but I also found other topics not as hard and I was able to get the flow of it. The best lesson in my opinion in this course were Forms. I enjoyed learning about how forms work and I thought it was cool to see how all these websites and pages use forms and how often we put our information into forms on different pages.</p>
